## Overview

This project is a comprehensive home lab built to sharpen infrastructure, networking, and automation skills. It serves as a living portfolio for demonstrating cloud-native and systems architecture competencies.

## Architecture

- Physical host running Proxmox VE  
- Multiple Linux VMs (e.g., DNS, app containers)  
- DHCP environment  
- Local DNS resolution using dnsmasq  
- SSH key-based authentication (ED25519)

## Features

- Proxmox hypervisor with GUI and CLI access  
- Wake-on-LAN setup for energy efficiency  
- Static DHCP leases and hostname resolution  
- Local DNS with dnsmasq  
- SSH hardened with key authentication only  
- Git Bash on Windows for SSH and remote management

## Installation

1. Set up Proxmox on bare metal  
2. Configure VMs with static IPs and hostnames  
3. Set up dnsmasq for DNS  
4. Disable root SSH, set up sudo user  
5. Generate SSH keys and copy with `ssh-copy-id`  
6. Install Git and configure terminal environment

## Usage

- SSH into VMs: `ssh user@vm-name.local`  
- Start Proxmox via Wake-on-LAN from another machine  
- Use Git Bash or PowerShell for terminal work

## Screenshots / Diagrams

_To be added: Network topology and Proxmox dashboard screenshots._

## Configuration

- `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: Root login disabled  
- `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`: Custom DNS entries  
- `~/.ssh/config`: Host shortcuts (optional)  
- System environment path configured for Git

## Security

- SSH: ED25519 keys, root login disabled  
- Local-only services, firewall enforced  
- Limited user accounts with sudo access

## Todo / Roadmap

- Add Docker containerization  
- Set up CI/CD pipelines  
- Implement monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana  
- Automate with Ansible or Terraform
